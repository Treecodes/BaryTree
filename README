Compiling and Testing the code
------------------------------

  Compiling : 
              The source code is written in Fortran90. To compile 
              on an Intel Fortran compiler to generate an executable,
			  exact_coul, for the direct computation, use:
			  
				   ifort -fast exact_coul.f90 -O3 -o exact_coul.
			
			  To generate an executable, tree_pc, for the 
              particle-cluster code use:

                   ifort -fast treedriver.f tree_pc.f90 -O3 -o tree_pc
				   
		      and for an executable, tree_cp, for the cluster-particle
			  code, use:
				   
				   ifort -fast treedriver.f tree_cp.f90 -O3 -o tree_cp


   Testing   :
   

              Make the files run_* executable by invoking 'chmod +x run_direct', 
			  'chmod +x run_pc', and 'chmod +x run_cp'. Then execute 
			  './run_direct >out1.txt &' to generate the exact energies and
			  time for direct summations for different sources and targets. 
			  The output for 10^4  sources and 10^5 targets is labeled ex_s4_t5.txt .
			  In general, the output for 10^n sources and 10^m targets is labeled
			  ex_sn_tm.txt . The outputs are input files for tree_pc and tree_cp .
			  
			  Execute './run_pc>out2.txt &' and './run_cp>out3.txt &' to approximate
			  the interactions using particle-cluster and cluster-particle 
			  respectively with different orders of multipole approximation.
              
                                                     
Input for the treedriver.f90 :
-------------------------------

      Treedriver is written to work with both tree_pc.f90 and tree_cp.f90.
      Treedriver will prompt the user for the following:

				    and charges of sources.
				
	  SAMPIN2     : (CHARACTER) Name of input files containing coordinates 
	                of targets.	
	  
	  SAMPIN3     : (CHARACTER) Name of input file containing the exact  
	                energy at of each target and the cpu time for direct 
				    summation.
				
	  SAMPOUT     : (CHARACTER) Name of output file
	  			
      NUMPARSS    : (INTEGER) Number of sources particles

      THETA       : (REAL*8) The multipole acceptance criterion.
	   
      ORDER       : (INTEGER) Order of the Taylor expansions used for the
                    approximation if the MAC is accepted.
 

      IFLAGS      : (INTEGER) Flag determining how source tree division terminates:

					IFLAGS=0  : Divide till number of particles in a leaf is less
				                or equal to a given number.
                    IFLAGS=1  : Divide till number of levels in a tree is equal to
								a given number.
 
	  IFLAGT      : (INTEGER) Flag determining how target tree division terminates:

                    IFLAGT=0  : Divide till number of particles in a leaf is less
				                or equal to a given number.
                    IFLAGT=1  : Divide till number of levels in a tree is equal to
								a given number.
						   
	  MAXPARNODES : (INTEGER) If IFLAGS=0, then division of a cluster terminates if
	                the number of particles in the cluster is less or equal to
					MAXPARNODES.

	  MAXPARNODET : (INTEGER) If IFLAGT=0, then division of a cluster terminates if 
	                the number of particles in the cluster is less or equal to

	                terminates if the cluster is at level=TREELEVELT.					

      SHRINKS     : (INTEGER) Adaptive switch used in the construction of the
	                 source tree. If SHRINKS=1, then the bounds of a cluster
					 are taken to be that of the minimal box that contains all
					 the particles in the cluster. Else, each cluster is 
					 divided into 8 child clusters of equal volume determined
					 by the midpoints in the x, y, z directions.


      SHRINKT     : (INTEGER) Adaptive switch used in the construction of the
	                 target tree. If SHRINKT=1, then the bounds of a cluster
